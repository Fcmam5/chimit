# Chimit (شيميط)

My pentesting/CTF toolset, unuseful for professionals and smart people, confusing for newbies like me.

I sometimes learn by building things, and sometimes things turn out to be useful.


## The name and inspiration

Chimit (شيميط) in Oran dialect is an untechnical fist, often used in fights in the street, sometimes it's effective to knockout "opponents", and sometimes, it'll be a waste of time and energy and makes you look like a fool when fighting.

That's exactly what this tool may do, it's been effective in few cases, but it's just a waste of time for many others.
